## Installation

### From Source

```bash
  cargo install starship-jj --locked
```

## Usage

1. Enable the plugin in your `starship.toml`:

```toml
format="""
...
${custom.jj}\
...
"""

#...

[custom.jj]
command = "prompt"
format = "$output"
ignore_timeout = true
shell = ["starship-jj", "--ignore-working-copy", "starship"]
use_stdin = false
when = true
```

Note there is no built-in way to automatically disable git modules in colocated repos. 

2. Configure what you want to see

starship-jj will load a configuration toml file either from the location provided via the `--starship-config` argument or from your OS's default config directory:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/starship-jj/starship-jj.toml` 
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/starship-jj/starship-jj.toml`

If no config file exists, starship-jj will use some sane default values.

You can see the default config location by using `starship-jj starship config path`.

You can also print the default configuration using `starship-jj starship config default`.

The repository also contains a `starship-jj.toml` file with all possible keys and documentation.
